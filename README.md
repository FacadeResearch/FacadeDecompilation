# FacadeDecompilation
 A work in progress decompilation of the front-end of the 2005 interactive story game, Facade.

# Notice
This is a "clean" decompilation rather than a 1:1 match-grade disassembly. While the logic is based on original assembly and pseudo C, I have also reformed the codebase for readability. Many implementation details (Such as file names, global variable organization, etc) are based on educated guesses and logical assumptions.
