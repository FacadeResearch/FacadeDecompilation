# FacadeDecompilation
 A work in progress decompilation of the front-end Windows release of the 2005 interactive story game, Facade.

# Notice
This decompilation will use symbols found in the MAC OS X release of the game to fill in the gaps of prior assumptions, but everything else that isn't known, will be guessed in a logical sense.
